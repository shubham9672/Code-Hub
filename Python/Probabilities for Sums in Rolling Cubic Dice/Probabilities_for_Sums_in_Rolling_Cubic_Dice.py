# PROBLEM
# After inputting the integer 'sum_' and the number of dice used ('dice_amount'), return the probability of finding the wanted sum between all the combinations 

# SOULTION
# This program uses recursion to find all the possible combinations of results with an inputted amount of dice 
# It returns the probability of having the sum of all dices equal to an expected sum between all combinations

# After defining in a list all possibile results when using one die the recursive function is defined with the amount of dice and a list as inputs
# In the default case a new list is defined and in it inserted every nested list inside the inputted one is insered with every number from one to six added to it (see example)
# After finishing the loops the function returns itself with the latest list and one less die
# When the dice amount equals to one (base case), it finally returns the list containing every possible result

# The second (2) part loops every nested list and calculates its sum, if equal to 'sum_' the counter goes up
# It finally returns in decimals the probability of finding the expected sum compared to the total cases
